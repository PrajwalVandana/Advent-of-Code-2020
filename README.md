# AdventofCode2020
Code that I'm proud of (so not all the days) for Advent of Code 2020

| Day | Name        |
| --- | ----------- |
| 4   | passport    |
| 7   | baggage     |
| 8   | code_reader |
| 10  | joltage     |
| 11  | seating     |
| 13  | buses       |
| 17  | cubes       |

Most (I think all) of the code is for part two of that day.
